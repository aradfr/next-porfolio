# CultureAR - Augmented Reality App

During my internship at **Cobblestone Interactive**, I had the incredible
opportunity to work on **CultureAR**, an innovative AR application developed
using Unity's **XR package** and **Firebase**. This app allows users to scan QR
codes at historical or cultural locations and view 3D models related to those
places in augmented reality through their smartphones.

## 🚀 Key Features of CultureAR

- **QR Code Scanning**: Users can scan QR codes placed at historical or cultural
  sites.
- **AR Experience**: After scanning, the app spawns 3D models of artifacts,
  structures, or culturally significant items directly in the user’s
  environment.
- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase is used for storing user data,
  authentication, and managing QR code metadata.
- **Google Authentication**: Allows users to log in and save their AR
  experiences and preferences.

## 🛠️ My Role in Development

As the **developer** on the CultureAR project, I was responsible for
implementing several core functionalities, including:

### 🔍 QR Code Scanning

- Designed and implemented the QR code scanning system using Unity's XR package
  and third-party libraries.
- Ensured smooth and accurate decoding of QR codes to retrieve corresponding
  data from Firebase.

### 🌍 Surface Detection & 3D Model Spawning

- Utilized Unity's AR Foundation for surface detection and placement of 3D
  models in the real-world environment.
- Optimized the spawning system to ensure realistic positioning and scaling of
  models based on the user’s surroundings.

### 🔗 Firebase Integration

- Connected the app to Firebase for seamless access to cloud-hosted QR code
  metadata and 3D model files.
- Implemented data retrieval and caching mechanisms to enhance app performance.

### 🔑 Google Authentication

- Integrated Google Auth through Firebase to allow users to log in and save
  their experiences.
- Ensured secure authentication and smooth user experience during sign-in and
  registration.

## 📂 Technologies Used

- **Unity**: XR package, AR Foundation, C# scripting
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore, and Storage
- **Google Authentication**: Firebase Auth integration
- **3D Modeling**: Integration of pre-designed 3D assets

## 🎨 Final Outcome

CultureAR successfully provided users with an immersive and educational
experience, bringing historical and cultural places to life through augmented
reality. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in AR development
but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities in creating seamless
interactions between the physical and digital worlds.
