# Spring Boot REST Controller for Fabrick API Integration

During my work with a **fintech company**, I developed a **RESTful banking
service** using **Spring Boot** to integrate with **Fabrick’s API**. This
project aimed to provide secure and efficient access to banking operations such
as **retrieving account balances, listing transactions, and handling money
transfers**.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

The banking service was designed with a **layered architecture**, ensuring
modularity, maintainability, and ease of testing. The integration with Fabrick’s
API required handling external API calls efficiently while maintaining local
persistence for **audit and traceability**.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 📌 Account Balance Retrieval

- Developed an API endpoint to fetch account balances via **Fabrick’s banking
  services**.
- Implemented **data validation and response parsing** for consistent API
  outputs.

### 📌 Transaction Listing with Date Filtering

- Built an endpoint to **fetch transactions** for a given date range.
- Ensured input validation (e.g., date formatting and range checks).
- Optimized API response handling for better performance.

### 📌 Money Transfer Functionality

- Implemented secure fund transfers with structured **request and response
  models**.
- Integrated **Spring Data JPA** for **local transaction logging** to provide an
  audit trail.

### 📌 Secure External API Communication

- Configured **RestTemplate** for seamless interaction with Fabrick’s API.
- Centralized external API configurations for scalability and security.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Architecture

- **Spring Boot** – RESTful API development
- **Spring Data JPA** – Persistence layer for transaction records
- **H2 Database** – Temporary in-memory storage for auditing
- **RestTemplate** – External API communication
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** – API documentation for easy client interaction
- **Jakarta Bean Validation** – Input validation for requests
- **Global Exception Handling** – Standardized error handling across services
- **JUnit & Mockito** – Unit and integration testing

## 🏆 Challenges & Solutions

### 🔍 API Response Handling

- **Challenge**: Handling inconsistent external API responses.
- **Solution**: Implemented a **custom response parser** to standardize data
  formats.

### 🔄 Secure Money Transfers

- **Challenge**: Ensuring secure transactions and proper logging.
- **Solution**: Implemented **custom exceptions and centralized transaction
  logging**.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization

- **Challenge**: Efficiently querying and storing large transaction data.
- **Solution**: Optimized database indexing and structured queries.

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrated my expertise in **Spring Boot, API integrations, and
secure financial application development**. The **scalability and
maintainability** of this REST controller make it a strong foundation for
fintech applications handling real-world banking transactions.
