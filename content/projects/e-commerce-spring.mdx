# 🛒 Full-Stack E-Commerce Website with Spring Boot & React (TypeScript)

I developed a **full-stack e-commerce website** using **Spring Boot** for the
back-end and **React (TypeScript)** for the front-end. The platform enables
users to **browse products, place orders online via Stripe**, and allows
administrators to **manage discounts and shipping through a custom-built admin
panel**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Front-End**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Back-End**: Spring Boot, Java, Spring Security, JPA (Hibernate)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Payments**: Stripe API
- **Authentication**: JWT & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🛍️ User Features

- **Product Catalog**: Browse through products with search and filtering
  options.
- **Secure Checkout**: Integrated **Stripe API** for safe and seamless payments.
- **Order Management**: Users can track their orders and view purchase history.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Sign up, log in, and manage accounts
  securely using **JWT-based authentication**.

### 🔧 Admin Panel Features

- **Discount Management**: Create and apply discounts to products dynamically.
- **Shipping Management**: Admins can **update order statuses, manage shipping
  details**, and track deliveries.
- **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized admins can access and modify orders,
  products, and discounts.

## 💳 Stripe Integration

Stripe is integrated to handle payments with:

- **Secure Transactions**: Ensures **PCI compliance** and encrypted payments.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Discounts applied by admins reflect immediately on
  checkout.
- **Refunds & Order Management**: Admins can **process refunds directly** from
  the admin panel.

## 🎨 User Experience & Design

- **Modern UI with React & TailwindCSS**: Ensuring a smooth and responsive
  experience.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Implemented lazy loading and efficient API
  calls.
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged TypeScript to minimize runtime errors and improve
  maintainability.

## 🚀 Challenges & Solutions

### 🔄 Secure & Scalable API

- Implemented **Spring Security & JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions.
- Designed a **RESTful API** with **role-based access control (RBAC)** to
  protect sensitive operations.

### 📈 Payment Processing with Stripe

- Configured Stripe for **one-time payments and dynamic pricing updates**.
- Ensured compliance with **secure payment best practices**.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization

- Used **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching.
- **Database indexing & query optimization** improved back-end performance.

## 📊 Future Improvements

- **Integrating AI-based recommendations** for personalized shopping
  experiences.
- **Implementing WebSockets** for real-time order status updates.
- **Adding multi-currency & international shipping support**.
