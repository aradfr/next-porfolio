# üó°Ô∏è Roguelike Adventure: Developing a 2D Roguelike Game with Unity

Embarking on the journey of game development, I undertook the challenge of
creating a 2D roguelike game using Unity. This project was guided by Unity's [2D
Roguelike Tutorial][1], which provided a comprehensive roadmap for building a
tile-based, procedurally generated dungeon crawler.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

The objective was to develop a turn-based roguelike game featuring:

- **Procedurally Generated Levels**: Each playthrough presents a unique dungeon
  layout, enhancing replayability.
- **Tile-Based Movement**: Both the player and enemies navigate the dungeon on a
  grid, moving one tile per turn.
- **Resource Management**: Players must collect food to maintain health, adding
  a strategic layer to exploration.
- **Enemy AI**: Implemented simple artificial intelligence for enemies to chase
  the player, increasing game difficulty.

## üß© Key Features Implemented

### 1. Procedural Level Generation

Utilizing algorithms to randomly generate dungeon layouts, ensuring that each
game session offers a distinct experience. This involved:

- **Random Placement of Walls and Obstacles**: Creating varied pathways and
  challenges.
- **Strategic Item Placement**: Distributing food and exit points to encourage
  exploration.

### 2. Turn-Based Mechanics

Designed a system where:

- **Player and Enemies Take Turns**: Actions occur in a sequential order,
  allowing for thoughtful decision-making.
- **Movement and Actions Are Quantized**: Each move or action corresponds to a
  single turn, maintaining a clear game rhythm.

### 3. Hunger System

Introduced a hunger mechanic where:

- **Food Items Restore Health**: Players must find food to survive, adding
  urgency to exploration.
- **Depleting Hunger Leads to Game Over**: Encourages efficient navigation and
  resource management.

### 4. Enemy Behavior

Developed enemy characters with basic AI to:

- **Chase the Player**: Enemies move towards the player's position when within a
  certain range.
- **Add Challenge**: Forces players to strategize movements to avoid or confront
  enemies.

### 5. Audio Integration

Enhanced the gaming experience by adding:

- **Background Music**: Sets the tone and atmosphere of the dungeon.
- **Sound Effects**: Provides feedback for player actions and events, such as
  collecting items or enemy encounters.

## üéÆ Personal Achievements

Through this project, I have:

- **Deepened Understanding of Procedural Generation**: Learned techniques for
  creating dynamic and unpredictable game environments.
- **Enhanced C# Programming Skills**: Applied complex programming concepts to
  manage game mechanics and AI behaviors.
- **Improved Problem-Solving Abilities**: Tackled challenges related to game
  design and implementation, leading to more efficient coding practices.

## üöÄ Next Steps

Building upon this foundation, I aim to:

- **Expand Game Mechanics**: Introduce new features such as diverse enemy types,
  traps, and power-ups.
- **Refine AI Systems**: Develop more sophisticated enemy behaviors to increase
  game depth.
- **Enhance Visuals and Audio**: Improve graphical assets and incorporate
  immersive soundscapes to enrich player experience.
